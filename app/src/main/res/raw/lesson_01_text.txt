[0:00]If you use Proton email or Proton Pass or any of the Proton apps, check out this new feature. In the case of an emergency, if you lose access to your account or maybe something happens to you, it is always good to have recovery options available. Now, Proton has already given us a number of different recovery options, including a recovery phrase, device-based recovery, but they've just introduced emergency access.
[0:21]This means that if something were to happen to you, you can set up a trusted contact. They have to have a Proton account, but it could be a free account. And then whenever they request that access, you can have it wait for a number of days.
[0:32] You will receive a notification that they've requested access, and you can either deny it, or if something has happened to you, this amount of time will have passed before they're giving full access to your Proton account, which could include your Proton mail, your Proton Pass, or any other Proton app that you use. Now, obviously, you shouldn't add an emergency contact that you don't implicitly trust, but at least now you have a secure way to pass along access to your accounts and your sensitive information if something were to happen to you.
