[0:00]Inside the bullet, a layer of soft metal is wrapped around a tiny super hard steel spike, 
[0:07]and when it hits the bulletproof vest, the soft metal flattens and peels away, 
[0:13]leaving the steel spike intact, meaning all its energy focuses on the very tip of the core. 
[0:20]The vest's woven fibers spread the impact across the weave, but the spike slips between them, 
[0:26]and the point drives through the fibers and any metal plates behind it. 
[0:32]So while a normal bullet would be stopped on impact, 
[0:35]the spike punches straight through it and into the flesh on the other side.
